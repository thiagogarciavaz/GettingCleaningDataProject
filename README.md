### Getting Cleaning Data Project
Project from Getting and Cleaning Data course (Coursera/Johns Hopkings)

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to work with a dataset from wearable devices.
The general purpose is to get, clean, merge and summarize the data, in order 
to reach a tidy and clean view of all amount of data.

## How does the code works?
The code is splited into seven steps.

1. Reading dataset: the first step is responsable to read features, activity
labels, variables, subjects and activities (both from train and test datasets)

2. Merging all data read
3. Filtering data
4. Putting descriptive activity names in the merged dataset
5. Labeling variables
6. Creating a new dataset, sumarized by activity and subject
7. Writing a file with the last dataset
